# Apache_airflow
- This repo consists of my practically created and practiced DAG's where these DAG's are mainly used for ETL Concepts.
- You need to have a Airflow version of 2.6.x and with python constraint 3.10.x to ensure the compatibility.
- The tools used for constructing these DAGs are WSL, VS Code.
